//what is space complexity?
//Space complexity is the amount of memory space required by an algorithm to run to completion. 

//It includes both the space needed for the input data and the space needed for auxiliary variables and data structures used during the computation.
//Space complexity is typically expressed using Big O notation, which describes the upper bound of the space required in terms of the size of the input data (n).
