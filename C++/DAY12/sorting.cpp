// sorting  ---> arranging data in a particular order(ascending/descending).

//in section short we arranging data in ascending order/decending order.

/*how to do sorting.?
ANSWER:
Changing the position of elements in sorting is the process of comparing two elements and swapping their positions to place them in the correct order.
 This comparison and swapping are repeated until all elements are arranged properly in either ascending or descending order.*/

 //Example--->

    //arrange the following data in ascending order---> [5,3,8,6,2]

//first we compare 5 and 2---> since 2 is smaller than 5 we swap their positions---> [2,3,8,6,5]
    //step1---> compare 5 and 2---> [2,3,8,6,5]

 //next we compare 3 and 8---> since 3 is smaller than 8 we do not swap their positions---> [2,3,8,6,5]
    //step2---> compare 3 and 8---> [2,3,8,6,5]

   //next we compare 5 and 6---> since 5 is smaller than 6 we swap their positions---> [2,3,6,8,5]
      //step3---> compare 5 and 6---> [2,3,5,6,8]

   
    //final its arranged in ascending order---> [2,3,5,6,8]

//sorting algorithms---> bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, heap sort etc.
