//Different between the machin code and Binary language.
//Machine code is the lowest-level representation of a program, consisting of binary instructions that a computer's processor can execute directly.
//Binary language, on the other hand, refers to any representation of data or instructions using the binary numeral system (0s and 1s). While machine code is a specific type of binary language used for executing instructions, binary language can also include data formats, file encodings, and other representations that utilize binary digits.

//compiler : A compiler is a program that translates source code written in a high-level programming language into machine code or another lower-level representation.


//why c language is written in c  language.
//C language is written in C language because it was designed to be a portable and efficient systems programming language. The creators of C, Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernighan, developed C as an evolution of the B programming language, which itself was influenced by BCPL (Basic Combined Programming Language). By writing C in C, they were able to leverage the language's features to create a powerful and flexible compiler that could be easily adapted to different hardware architectures. This self-referential approach also helped demonstrate the capabilities of the C language and facilitated its widespread adoption in systems programming and software development.
